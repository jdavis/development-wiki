                The community polls are a way to let the community decide how
                to spend the money donated. By voting, you will have a say in
                the development process.

                The Neovim Community has written a style guide to show the
                proper form to follow when contributing to the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keeping the code uniform and consistent across the project is
                important for maintainability.

                Through Bountysource, you are now able to donate to the Neovim
                team. All the donations received will go towards the
                development of Neovim. Any amount donated is very much
                appreciated by the community.
            </p>
            <p>
                From time to time, the team will create a bounty for a certain
                feature or bug with the money donated. If you successfully
                implement the feature or fix the bug, you'll be rewarded for
                your efforts.
