                The community polls are a way to let the community decide how
                to spend the money donated. By voting, you will have a say in
                the development process.

                The Neovim Community has written a style guide to show the
                proper form to follow when contributing to the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keeping the code uniform and consistent across the project is
                important for maintainability.
