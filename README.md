# Neovim Development Wiki

## Running Locally

```bash
$ jekyll serve --watch --baseurl '/development-wiki'

```

Since the [dev-wiki][dev-wiki] is on the same domain as the main
[neovim.org][neovim] site, we can't use the base URL as '/'. This will let
resources to work as well as links.

[dev-wiki]: http://neovim.org/development-wiki/
[neovim]: http://neovim.org
